# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##Project description :
This mini app allows its users to list the most starred github repositories. The list may contain arround 900 to 999 repository for only the first 1000 search results are available.
I developped this app using Reactjs library alongside:
Axios : for HTTP calls to set a communication with Github api , 
Reactstrap components,
IntersectionObserver to implement the infinit scroll wich is a simple way to implement it if we want to avoid using whithout using a thirdparty node module.

##How to use it :
The app displays a list of the most starred Github repositories, one repository per row you just need to keep scrolling and more result will show up untill reaching the last repository.
